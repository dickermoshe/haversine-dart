# Haversine formula in Dart
"The haversine formula determines the great-circle distance between two points on a sphere given their longitudes and latitudes" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula).
This file is the implementation of the formula in Dart. I have also posted it on Rosseta Code (https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Haversine_formula#Dart).
